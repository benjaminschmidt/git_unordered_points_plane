# Variation of stability for moduli spaces of unordered points in the plane (v1.0)

SageMath code for computations in the article

`Variation of stability for moduli spaces of unordered points in the plane`

by Patricio Gallardo and Benjamin Schmidt.

Files in the folder `additional` contain code that is not required for the
proofs in the article, but provide additional checks and confidence in the
numerous calculations.

# How to run the Jupyter notebooks online

The simplest way to run the code is online on [cocalc.com](https://cocalc.com). Run:

`git clone https://github.com/benjaminschmidt/git_unordered_points_plane.git`

in a terminal. You should then be able to open the Jupyter notebooks.

# How to run the Jupyter notebooks locally

To install SageMath locally check the [installation guide](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/). You need to start a Jupyter session with SageMath. Depending on your system that might happen by running

`sage -n jupyter`

in the console.
